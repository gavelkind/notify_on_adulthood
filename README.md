This mod for Crusader Kings II lets players request a notification when a specific child reaches the age of 16. It is useful for inviting heirs before they marry.

If Conclave is enabled, a separate interaction lets players request a notification when a child reaches age 12, when it is important to select a guardian depending on childhood traits.

![img](https://www.squarefree.com/crusaderkings/icons/Ironman_enabled_restrictions_24.png) This mod disables ironman achievements. It only gives you faster access to information you already have, but it does so by adding decisions and events, so the game engine considers it a possible cheat.
